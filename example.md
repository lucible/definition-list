This is an example term
: this is the first definition

: this is another definition. this is rendered in live preview as a definition but not in reading mode. bit of a bug?

_Italic Term_
  : with an indented definition
  : and another indented definition and _italic_ and **bold** and ==highlight== and [link](https://example.com)

`Code Term`
  ~ with a tilde for the definition marker and `inline code` and ~~strikethrough~~
  ~ another definition and _italic_ and **bold** and ==highlight== and [link](https://example.com)

[This is a linked term](https://example.com)
: This is a definition for the linked term.

##### headings shouldn't be terms
: so the definition rendering doesn't display.

```

: another definition
